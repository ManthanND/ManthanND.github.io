The Jigs and Fixture Design process for KPT Internship Project had following phases:

### Jig Design for Plate hole drilling via Vertical Drilling Machine
This consisted of an industrial part drawing of plate to be mass manufactured. To guide the drilling tool via holes, a support in form of Jig was expected. Considering all the dimensions of tool and part, we created Jig design via AutoCAD with right tolerances to be manufactured
### Fixture Design
In this project problem statement, a key-lot for electric motor spindle was expected. All the dimensions pertaining to key slot, spindle dimensions. So a V shaped Vice fixturing was developed for the same. The 3D part model via SOLIDWORKS was submitted to KPT
### Industrial Implementation
After all the designs submitted the parts Jig and Fixture were manufactured locally and verified. After few iterations we finalized the parts and the company later used for mass manufacturing.
